# Bash :: Scripting

Shell scipting is by tradition split into two approaches:
- POSIX compatible scripts, .sh suffix, common denominator across the shells
- bash scripting, .bash suffix, bashisms, new bash features

The first approach favors maximum compatibility not only between different bash versions, but across many differentshells as well; because most shells have the POSIX emulation mode in which they behave as close to some prehistoric standard inadvertently set by the Bourne shell (sh).
