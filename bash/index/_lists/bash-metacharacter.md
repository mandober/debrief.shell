# Bash :: Index :: Metacharacters

Metacharacters are the individual characters with special meaning to the shell that make up *shell operator*'s names, either by themselves alone (as a single character), or in combination with one or more metacharacters and/or ordinary characters.

In fact, all the metacharacters listed below are valid shell operators when they occur alone; that is, except parenthesis, which always occur as a pair, and are usually used to surround other shell words (for various purposes like forcing a subshell `$(…)`, forcing a precedence, etc.)


A **shell operator** is a command internal to the shell, with a name that consists of at least one metacharcter, with additional characters being other metacharcters or ordinary characters.
