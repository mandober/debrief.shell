# Shell :: GLOSSARY

## Shell
A shell is a program that provides an interface to operating system's services to users or other programs. Its name stems from the fact that it is the outermost layer around the OS.

Human to computer interaction employs various types of interfaces, but the two most common ones are the *command-line interface* (CLI) and *graphical user interface* (GUI). The corresponding shells associated with these two interfaces are *command-line shell* and *graphical shell* (the term "shell" usually refers to the former).

## Command-line shell
## Command-line interface

The main component of a command-line interface is the *command line*. 

Today, a command line is just a place on the screen designated for typing in commands (in the past, the users typed the commands at the physical terminal). 

Today, *terminal emulators* are actually used, which emulate hardware terminals in the software. So the user sits at a typing commands in the terminal emulator, which acts a console that hosts the shell. The shell in turn provides a command-line interface.

The shell then interprets the command, replying it to the OS. The OS executes the command and sends the output of the command back to the shell which displays it to the user (to monitor today, to printer in the past).



A command-line shell requires the user to be familiar with
- the names of commands available on the system
- with the syntax the shell uses to call them
- with the specific shell language
